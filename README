TRAP Overview
=============

Trap presents the user a web interface to configure an analysis. A grid scheduler checks for
this configuration and runs it in sequence and results are copied to user directory and
made available via the web interface.

Trap uses:
httpd		- to present dashboard via web interface
mysqldb/mariadb - to store user information and job meta data
Sun Gridengine 	- to batch run analyses
R 		- to run actual analyses

Trap is programmed in SQL / R / HTML and PHP
