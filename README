TRAP Overview
=============

Trap presents the user a web interface to configure an analysis. A grid scheduler checks for
this configuration and runs it in sequence and results are copied to user directory and
made available via the web interface.

Trap uses:
httpd		- to present dashboard via web interface
mysqldb/mariadb - to store user information and job meta data
Sun Gridengine 	- to batch run analyses
R 		- to run actual analyses

Trap is programmed in SQL / R / HTML and PHP

The folder provide:
   backend - the R scripts, transcriptome data and analysis invokation shell scripts  
   sql     - database layouts for users, jobs for the web frontend
   www     - PHP web application code - web frontend 

In order to manually run: check the comments in the R scripts inside the backend directory (SCALED-PREDICTOR-XXXX.R)
